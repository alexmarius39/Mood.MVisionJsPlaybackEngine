Hi Marius,
I have some answers from Samsung on your questions. Please take a look at the answers below. Between <Samsung> tags.

A. File Systems Questions/Help:
> >     ============================
> >        1.  Can you supply us, a sample code for the zip / unzip functionalities using SSSP Tizen API?

<Samsung>
        Refer to https://www.samsungdforum.com/B2B/cmsguide/GuideView/8981
        Check for add and extract all API
        I donâ€™t have a demo for this specifically
        For extract all refer to the following demo http://13.56.70.14:81/repoapi/DEMOS/NodeCMS.wgt
        Under file js/helpers/filesystem.js line 13.

<Samsung>
        Refer to the following demo for Copy
        http://13.56.70.14:81/repoapi/TIZEN/FileSystemTV.wgt

<Samsung>
        Refer to the following demo for delete dir including content
        http://13.56.70.14:81/repoapi/TIZEN/FileSystemTV.wgt

>     B. How to install and start a Tizen Application (a Widget) on SSSP - not from the TVdevice menus (via url or via usb) - but programmatically from our code? Do you have these functionalities accessible via Tizen API functions?
<Samsung>
         There are no ways that an SSSP application can install another SSSP application, what can be done via API is to control where to search from an application. For example control the URL launcher URL.
        This can be achieved http://13.56.70.14:81/repoapi/B2BCONTROL/B2BUrlLauncher.wgt

<Samsung>This must be controlled from the CMS side. Device does not have the ability to have a history of all applications installed. </mario>

<Samsung>
        Check the following demo
        http://13.56.70.14:81/repoapi/B2BCONTROL/B2BPowerControl.wgt

> >      C. How to access local html pages placed on some usb folders as local web urls/uris specified in iframes
<Samsung>
        You will need to provide the absolute path of such a resource. For example if you have a video called video1.mp4 inside your USB
        IN the iframe must be called as opt/media/USBDriveA1/a1s.mp4 In order to display it.
        Absolute path can be obtained from the filesystem demo.

<Samsung>
        For the question related concatenation try checking the API https://www.samsungdforum.com/B2B/cmsguide/GuideView/8982#FileStream
        This api will allow you to create files to store strings and also concatenate to existing files.
